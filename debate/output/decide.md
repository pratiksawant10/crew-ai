After considering the presented argument, the debate opposing the motion has provided a more convincing argument. The argument against the law that all cars must be electric presents a comprehensive point of view that takes into account the full spectrum of social, economic, and environmental impacts such a law would have. In contrast, the argument for the law focusses predominantly on potential environmental benefits, but fails to adequately address the associated challenges such as the impact on low-income households, the strain on power grids, and the dependence on specific rare earth materials which have their own environmental and ethical issues. 

Importantly, it also raises the crucial point that other eco-friendly technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells and biofuels need to be considered alongside electric cars, arguing that a variety of technologies should co-exist in the transition away from purely ICE motor vehicles. 

Therefore, the proposition that a variety of solutions, including electric vehicles, other low-carbon technologies, and even changes to city infrastructure to support sustainable urban mobility, provides a more nuanced and robust approach to the complex issue of mitigating climate change and reducing pollution. This is the reasoning behind choosing the opposing argument in this debate.
