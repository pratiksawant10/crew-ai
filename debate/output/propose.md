Strongly supporting the motion that there ought to be a law which mandates all cars to be electric, my argument centers on three prongs - the ecological benefit, the economic prospect, and technological evolution. 

As regards ecological benefit, one cannot contest the cataclysmic evidence of climate change, to which carbon emissions significantly add. Switching from gasoline-powered cars to electric vehicles (EVs) promises a marked reduction in tailpipe emissions, which currently accounts for a tremendous chunk of air pollution. Thus, mandating the use of electric cars is a crucial step towards safeguarding our environment.

Economically speaking, reports indicate that the average electric vehicle could save its owner on overall costs, particularly factoring in the low operating costs over time. Further, oil price volatility will cease to be a worry for electric car owners - thereby leading to more predictable expenses for households.

On technology, electric cars are currently the leading edge. There's substantial business and human capital value to be harvested from developing, producing, and maintaining the emerging fleet of electric vehicles and the ancillary infrastructure necessary to support them. Hence, a mandate that all cars be electric could foster a full-scale embrace of this emerging technology, securing our position in a rapidly evolving industrial future.

Therefore, owing to the salient contributions in environmental protection, economic saving, and technological progression, I firmly advocate the motion calling for a law enforcing the use of electric cars.
