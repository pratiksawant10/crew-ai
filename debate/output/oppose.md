First, the instantaneous implementation of this law overlooks the significant economic impact it has, especially on low-income families who might not be able to afford electric cars, even if they are projected to be less expensive in the future. The transition should be gradual, giving consumers the possibility to adjust their finances accordingly.

Second, it's important to consider the energy production that fuels electric cars. It's true that electric cars produce zero emissions at the tailpipe, but the electricity that charges these cars still largely comes from fossil fuels, especially coal and natural gas. To truly ascertain the entire emission footprint of electric vehicles, we must also factor in the emissions from power plants. 

Third, focusing solely on electric cars overlooks the potential of other green technologies. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, for example, as well as biofuel-powered cars, can also be part of the solution to mitigating climate change. 

Fourth, the mass usage of electric cars poses a strain on our power grid. It requires major upgrades to our power infrastructure, which involves significant financial costs. The over-reliance on lithium, cobalt, and other rare earth metals that are used in the production of electric vehicle batteries also poses significant sourcing and ethical problems. 

In conclusion, while the transition to cleaner modes of transport is crucial, instituting a law that mandates all cars to be electric is an oversimplification of a very complex issue. It could lead to other societal and environmental problems if it's not rolled out strategically and in recognition of other concurrently useful technological advancements. I propose focusing on a mixed solution that includes electric vehicles, but also considers other low-carbon technologies, as well as a redesign of our cities to promote more sustainable urban mobility options like cycling and walking.
